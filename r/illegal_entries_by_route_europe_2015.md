Note from Frontex:
As of October 2014, the data for the route to Apulia and Calabria have been included in the Central Mediterranean route. Indeed, many migrants are disembarked in Apulia and Calabria even though they have been detected in the Central Mediterranean area. However, the current reporting mechanism does not break down by areas of detections, but by areas of disembarkation, thus a distinction of detections between these two routes is not available.
